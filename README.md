## what-i-learned
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in:
- **HTML**: Structuring web content and using semantic elements.
- **CSS**: Styling web pages, using flexbox for layout, and implementing transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Handling events, manipulating the DOM, and making asynchronous requests.
- **JSON Files**: sending and receiving data from a JSON Files asynchronously. This means you can update parts of a web page without refreshing the whole page.


## Continued Development
In the future, I plan to:
- Add more categories and questions.
- Implement a backend to store user scores and progress.
- Enhance the UI/UX with more animations and responsive design.
